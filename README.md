* First combine all javascript together
* Remove all debug code, godMode, soundEnable, and controls description
* Use Google Closure on Advanced https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
* Use terser with extra compression turned off https://xem.github.io/terser-online/
* Put eveything into the same html file and remove any whitespace
* Zip the index.html and tiles.png files
* Zip the zip with advzip using the settings "-z -4 -i 1000" https://github.com/amadvance/advancecomp
* Say a small prayer to the gods of JavaScript
* The final result should hopefully be under 13k!
